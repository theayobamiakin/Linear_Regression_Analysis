Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.This line can be used to predict future values.Simple linear regression is an approach for predicting a response using a single feature.
It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related. Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value(y) as accurately as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable(x).

For generality, we define:
x as feature vector, i.e x = [x_1,x_2,....x_n]
y as response vector,i.e y = [y_1,y_2,....y_n]
for n observations 
In this case n=!0
x= [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
y= [1,3,2,5,7,8,8,9,10,12]
